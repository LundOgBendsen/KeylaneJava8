/*class Author {

	class Book {
	   String name;
	   int year;
	   Author author;
	}
	Let’s imagine that we need to print all authors in a books collection who wrote a book after 2005. How would we do it in Java 7?

	for (Book book : books) {
	   if (book.author != null && book.year > 2005){
	       System.out.println(book.author.name);
	   }
	}
	And how would we do it in Java 8?


	books.stream()
	       .filter(book -> book.year > 2005)  // filter out books published in or before 2005
	       .map(Book::getAuthor)              // get the list of authors for the remaining books
	       .filter(Objects::nonNull)          // remove null authors from the list
	       .map(Author::getName)              // get the list of names for the remaining authors
	       .forEach(System.out::println);     // print the value of each remaining element*/
