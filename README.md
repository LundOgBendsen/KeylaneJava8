# Java 8 workshop for Keylane Developers

# Exercise guide

## Building & Running

 * In the `src/` folder: there are code snippets to study and run / debug to better your understanding of key concepts
 * In the `test/` folder: there are exercices for you 
 * Gradle script will build the project and run the tests (ie your exercises for you). 
 
 In a shell, type
 ` ./gradlew build`
 
From eclipse: 
Gradle Tasks view >  doubleclick the task 'build'

As a result, you should see a message, that the tests have failed! Actually, ALL the tests are falling. It is your job, as a student at the workshop, to fix the tests, while learning a good deal about Java 8 at the same time.

## Doing the exercises
Every lesson has a corresponding file in the `src/test/java` folder.

The exercises are named `Lesson_xx_name.java`

There are 2 exercises with an extra challenge, they are named Lesson_xx_challenge.java. These extra challenges should only be done, if you feel that the material is really easy for you.

Your job is to implement a piece of code (look for the `// FIXME` comment), so that the test is green.
